# Trigger-Action-lighting-system-
Cloud for IoT project 2017 - A WeB Of things approach to intelligent lighting


With  the  book  Building  the  Web  of  Things  as  basis,  we  have  devel-oped a trigger action customizable lighting system. This is done us-ing the principles and technologies Dominique D. Guinard and VladM.  Trifa  [3]  guides  you  through.  The  project  is  based  on  Node.js,Javascipt  and  cloud  integration  which  supports  a  system  with  highscalability.  What  has  been  created  is  a  system  that  allows  a  user  tocustomize different reminders in forms of various light settings. Thisis done through user configurations of colors, as well as through hisGoogle calender data, Google directions and weather data. To furtherenhance  the  lighting  system  a  photoresistor  as  well  as  a  Bluetoothmodule has been added, to save power in the everyday life. By turn-ing off the lights when the user leaves home, and adjusting the bright-ness of the lights dependent on the actual environmental lights mayit be from the sun or street lights. The use of Bluetooth also enablesthe system to detect multiple users. Oauth2.0is used for authenticat-ing users, as well as authenticating the server to make API requestson behalf of the user. The system is capable of having several users,each with their own personal settings, which will only affect the light-ing conditions, if they are home and in priority. This prototype willbe used to make a heuristic evaluation which enables a discussion ofthe technologies in use, and their uses in real world personal lightingsystems and smart homes in general
